# Pinecone-Based Retriever

This repository contains a project that demonstrates the implementation of a scalable vector search using Pinecone, enabling efficient document retrieval based on semantic similarity. The project is designed to integrate with language models for embedding generation, facilitating tasks such as question-answering and information retrieval.

## Features

- **Vector Store with Pinecone**: Utilize Pinecone for storing and searching dense vector embeddings.
- **Integration with Language Models**: Use Hugging Face or OpenAI embeddings for generating vector representations.
- **Efficient Search**: Perform similarity-based search for document retrieval in milliseconds.
- **Scalable**: Supports large-scale datasets with optimized query response times.
