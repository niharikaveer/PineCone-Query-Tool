# Pinecone Query Tool
This repository demonstrates the implementation of a Pinecone-based retriever for efficient and scalable vector search. The project leverages the power of Pinecone, a high-performance vector database, to store and retrieve embeddings for similarity search applications such as document retrieval, question answering, and more.

## Key Components
1. **Pinecone Initialization**:
   - Connects to Pinecone using API keys.
   - Creates and manages an index for storing vector embeddings.
2. **Embedding Generation**:
   - Generates embeddings using models such as HuggingFace Transformers.
3. **Indexing**:
   - Processes documents or data to generate embeddings and uploads them to the Pinecone index.
4. **Querying**:
   - Performs similarity-based retrieval by comparing query embeddings with indexed embedding
